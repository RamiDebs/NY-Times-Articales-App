# NY-Times-Articles-App
Android App Assignment

Hello World!

I created this app with hope and hard work to make it perfect.
I hope you will like it.

The app is a detail/master for the NY Times.
It contains 2 views: 1- portrait view (Clicking on the item will open a new activity)
2-landscape view (2 fragments beside each other)

*Each row has 2 things: 1-details about the article and newspaper image button
-clicking on the newspaper will lunch the article URL on the browser

Things I used in the app:
-MVVM Arch
-LiveData
-Junit for a simple test
-Espresso for testing the RView
-Glide for image loader
-Activities and fragments 

I tried my best to make the code simple and I have added comments.

any questions?
